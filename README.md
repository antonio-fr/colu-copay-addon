[Copay](https://github.com/bitpay/copay) addon with support for [Colu](http://colu.co).

Not really an addon, since Copay doesn't have addon system, but rather an easy to drop in
bunch of code that makes Copay aware of ColoredCoins. Works for Copay 1.8.*,
may not work with other versions.

# Setup

Use coluProvider to set Colu API key:

````
coluProvider.setApiKey("<YOUR COLU API KEY>");
````
